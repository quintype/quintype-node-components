# @quintype/components

This is a set of *viewless* components that is to be used to build a Quintype Publisher App with the [malibu](https://github.com/quintype/malibu) framework. These components handle a variety of common functionality like resizing images, and handling logins in a performant way.

If you are looking for a good place to start, take a look at the [malibu tutorial](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/tutorial).

## Installing

`@quintype/components` is already installed into projects generated from malibu by default. However, if you wish to install it separately, or upgrade the version, then simply the following to get the latest version.

## Images
